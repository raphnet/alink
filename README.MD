# ALINK-Linux

## Overview

This is a Linux port of ALINK V1.6, by Anthony A.J. Williams.

I used the original files are available from sourceforge which were
under the Artistic License, but on 2020-07-17, the author relicensed
the project under the GPLv3.

## Linux changes

Not a very complicated "port", changes are minor...

  * Added a Makefile for Linux (old Makefile renamed to Makefile.orig)
  * Renamed all files to lowercase
  * Added implementations of strupr() and stricmp()
  * Fix a ton of warnings

## Examples

A simple example to build a DOS 16-bit .EXE file from .OBJ
files generated by NASM is included under the example/ directory.

Win32 examples using TASM and NASM by the original author are
available from the sourceforge website.
